# From nothing, to something, to everything
1 Nov 2025

## Where I am at:
I am a Research Assistant in Uchicago for the School of Business.
I am in a Masters Degree in Applied Data Science

I HAVE NOT secured an internship
I HAVE NOT secured a job

## Where I want to go:
I need to stay in the US
That can look in a different couple ways:
	1. Corporate (OPT / H1B Visa) Normal company 
	2. Startup / Medium Size (TN Visa) flatter org and closer to HR
	3. PHD -> unknown territory since 
		I am just starting doing research
		no published papers (yet)

Routes:
	Internship -> Final Quarter of Masters -> Full time offer OPT
	Final Quarter of Masters -> Full time offer OPT
	PHD applications (right now Fall 2025) -> Final Quarter of Masters -> PHD 

Monday November 3rd -> interview with Redacted
Spring -> Message Redacted to sign for an internship
	but no promises yet
If I think circularly my life will reflect this
My mind can lift anything
