QTCM -> Questions that came to mind
# Question 1:

What is the L2 Norm of the vector u = [4,3,0]?

```python
import torch

# Step 1: Define the vector as a Pytorch vector
u = torch.tensor([4.0, 3.0, 0.0]) # float is important for norm ops

l2_norm = torch.norm(u, p=2) # computes the l2 norm euclidean norm

print("L2 Norm:", l2_norm.item()) # is used to extract the scalar value from a 0D Tensor
```
QTCM
1. Why is p=2 in the L2 norm?
p in torch.norm(..., p=...) refers to p-norm:

p=1 ‚Üí Manhattan norm

p=2 ‚Üí Euclidean norm (L2 norm)

p=‚àû ‚Üí Max norm (largest absolute value)

2. What happens if you don't use .item()?
l2_norm stays a 0 dimensional tensor
```python
print(l2_norm)
# tensor(5.)

print(type(l2_norm))
# <class 'torch.Tensor'>
```

## Question 2:

What is the L2 Norm of the vector u = [-2,2,1]?

```python
u = torch.tensor([-2.0, 2.0, 1.0])

l2_norm = torch.norm(u, p=2)
print(l2_norm.item())
```


## Question 3:
What is the cosine of the angle between the following two vectors?

U = [1 , 2, 2], v= [0, 4, 3]

```python
# define the vectors
u = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 2.0])
v = torch.tensor([0.0, 4.0, 3.0])

# dot product
dot_product = torch.dot(u,v)

# Compute l2 norms
u_l2norm = torch.norm(u, p=2)
v_l2norm = torch.norm(v, p=2)

cos_theta = dot_product / (u_l2norm * v_l2norm)

print(cos_theta.item())

```


## Question 4:
What is the matrix multiplication of the following two matrices?

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 2 \\
    4 & 3 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
    -1 & 0 \\
    5 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

```python
A = torch.tensor([[-1.0, 2.0],
                  [4.0, 3.0]])

B = torch.tensor([[-1.0, 0.0],
                  [5.0, 1.0]])

result = A @ B
```

## Question 5:
What is the determinant of the follwowing matrix?

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & -2 & 2 \\
    2 & -4 & 1 \\
    4 & -8 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

```python
A = torch.tensor([[1.0, -2.0, 2.0],
                  [2.0, -4.0, 1.0]
                  [4.0, -8.0, 1.0]
])

det_A = torch.linalg.det(A)
print(det_A.item())
```

[1.0, 2.0, 1.0]

# 1. Define the matrixes
A = torch.tensor([
[1.0, 2.0, -1.0],
[2.0, 10.0, 3.0],
],dtype = dtype)

b = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0],dtype = dtype)

# 2. Reshape b to be a column vector (2, 1) for matrix operations

```
You and I are trying to find a location on a map ‚Äî a flat grid.
You must end up somewhere where the sum of your east and north steps is 5

x + y = 5

This one rule doesn't lock in exactly where you are‚Ä¶ but it does tell you all the places you could be.

Suppose I also tell you:

You must end up somewhere where x - y = 1

only one pair works for both equations:
x = 3, y = 2
If you only had x + y = 5, you were free to slide anywhere along the line.
That‚Äôs what an underdetermined system is:
 Imagine You‚Äôre in 3D Space Now
Instead of walking on a flat map (2D), now you can:

Walk east ‚Üí x

Walk north ‚Üí y

Climb upstairs ‚Üí z

Now you're looking for a location in 3D.
x + y + z = 6
This is just one equation with three unknowns.

Can we find a unique point?

Nope. There are infinitely many combinations that satisfy this.
Add a Second Rule:
x - y + z = 1
infinite valid solutions, but more restricted now.
```python
A = torch.tensor([
    [1.0, 2.0, -1.0],
    [2.0, 10.0, 3.0]
], dtype=torch.float32)

b = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0], dtype=torch.float32).reshape(2, 1)
```
system of equations is:
1¬∑x + 2¬∑y - 1¬∑z = 1       ‚Üí equation 1
2¬∑x + 10¬∑y + 3¬∑z = 2      ‚Üí equation 2
A.shape = (2, 3)
2 equations
3 unknowns: x, y, and z
this is an underdetermined system.

## Question 10:

# It's best practice to use a floating-point dtype for these operations.
dtype = torch.float32

A = torch.tensor([[2.,  3.,  4.],
                  [2.,  3., -4.],
                  [2., -3.,  4.]], dtype=dtype)

b = torch.tensor([6., 4., 2.], dtype=dtype)

print("Matrix A:")
print(A)
print("\nVector b:")
print(b)
print("-" * 25)

# 2. Solve for the vector x in the equation Ax = b
# torch.linalg.solve is the recommended function for this.
try:
    solution = torch.linalg.solve(A, b)

    print("The system has a unique solution.")
    print("Solution vector (x, y, z):")
    print(solution)
    print("-" * 25)

    # 3. Print the results in a more readable format
    x, y, z = solution[0].item(), solution[1].item(), solution[2].item()
    print(f"Solved values are:")
    print(f"x = {x:.4f}")
    print(f"y = {y:.4f}  (fractional value is 2/3)")
    print(f"z = {z:.4f}  (fractional value is 1/4)")
    print("-" * 25)


    # 4. (Optional but recommended) Verify the solution
    # We check if A multiplied by our solution vector gives us back b.
    print("Verification: Multiplying A by the solution...")
    reconstructed_b = torch.matmul(A, solution)
    print("Result of A @ x:")
    print(reconstructed_b)

    # Use torch.allclose to confirm the result is numerically close to the original b
    is_correct = torch.allclose(reconstructed_b, b)
    print(f"\nIs the solution correct? {is_correct}")

except torch.linalg.LinAlgError:
    print("The matrix A is singular (not invertible).")
    print("The system either has no solution or infinite solutions.")
