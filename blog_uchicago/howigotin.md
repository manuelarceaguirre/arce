Now listen. I was born 20 meters from the US-Mexico border. 20 meters. It really sucks. Studying in the US, getting a job, and starting a family became my obsession since I could speak. All my rich kid friends were going to a high school across the border, I even got a scholarship, but my parents sat me down and told me a phrase that would repeat on my mind for years:

> Son, it's too expensive. For people like us, it's impossible to study in the US.

A lof of times I would get excited because I was finally making progress and then I would remember the words:

> It's too expensive.
> It's impossible.
> It's not worth it.
> You are not going to make it.

And I did not have any idea on how to make this possible. So here is exactly everything I did, my thought process, and the resources I used. So you can do it too, everytime you hear these stupid phrases: Come back to this guide. Follow this plan. Stick to it and think that if a guy from Mexico with less money than your average American Mcdonald's employee, got in, you can do it too. Without my girlfriend, I would not have been able to get in. So find someone that will support you, if you don't have one, DM me and I will remind you every day you better fucking get going.

I discovered UChicago's program - completely unaware of its prestige and acceptance rate at the time. Ironically, I only looked up the acceptance rate (a daunting 6%-8%) after I'd already paid for and submitted my application. Applied Data Science seemed like my best shot, given that I had just graduated with a Bachelor's in Actuarial Science from a Mexican university. The coursework aligned well with my background, and the program appeared comprehensive.

I scheduled my first and only information session, and by some stroke of luck, ended up having the call with one of the higher-ups in the program.

I once read that universities not only look at your grades and accomplishments but another part of the decision is only based on ✨vibes✨

When I asked about UChicago's unique qualities, I got the standard response:
> "Academic Excellency... need for highly technical individuals in business decisions..."

Nothing special ok NEXT
  
Then I asked about the difference between Applied Data Science and regular Data Science:
> "If you want to do a PhD go Data Science, if not do Applied" 

Okkk that's me NEXT

I wanted him to reveal the ✨vibes✨ that would let me in the door. I needed a theme in my application. Why am I better than another guy with perfect scores, awards, and success INSIDE the US? It's not a secret that Mexican curriculums are FKN EASY compared to these monsters.

So I asked the key question:
> "What do the faculty members believe in, what matters most to them?"
> "Collaboration is a big thing for us."

FINALLY SOMETHING USEFUL!

So I decided to gather everything that I did in college and work life. Try to select the most Collaboration-oriented things and center my whole application on this single theme: Collaboration.

I did not lie though. I have this power that in classrooms I would always make friends the very first day and together we aced every exam and every homework by teaming up and beating the professor at his own game. In my past jobs, I have been the middle man lots of times and always made entire teams work together. 

## 2 Letters of Recommendation
This is where the fun begins. You can't just expect people to write you a banger of a letter. Saying what to write is not an option either. So what do you do?

You psyop them.
My strategy was the following:

I texted my youngest teacher if she could write me a letter. But I wanted to tell her more about the university and the program. We sat down, gossiped, catched up, and then I reminded her all the collaboration stories I remembered from her class. Collaboration this Collaboration that. All the time. 

For the second letter I actually texted the HEAD OF THE ENTIRE CONTINENT, it turns out my direct supervisor and him are named the same. He was super cool about it. Same thing. Called him, gossiped, catched up, and then I reminded him all the collaboration stuff I did in the company.

## Candidate Statement
I tend to always write about my feelings but seeing lots of examples online I realized this is a bad strategy. I DO NOT recommend to be funny, the reality is you don't know what is funny for a professor or a scholarship committee.

I cloned this guys template and started writing. He even has instructions on how to use it.

```latex
%% Why do you wish to attend graduate school? What would you like to study? Keep it broad, details come-in later
%% Describe 2-3 past projects that might be relevant to your research interests. (10-12 lines per project)
% PROJECT 1: P3 - Distributed Graph Neural Network Training at Scale
% PROJECT 2: SURGEON - Early-Exit Inference

## Programming Supplement
This was the hardest part. The challenge is to keep it under 2 pages. So I just included the most important lines of the whole code and included a link to a visual demo of the code and a link to the github repo.

## Virtual Portfolio
Short, recorded videos.
Get a nice background, put on a dress shirt, be authentic, talk like you are giving a lecture but you are the really cool professor that sits at the desk and they make a clip out of you and they post it on X. 
That is the aura I went for.

## English Language Requirement
TOEFL resources I used. The speaking section was the only thing I did not have a perfect score when I practiced: [TOEFL TestReady](https://www.ets.org/toefl/test-takers/ibt/prepare/toefl-testready.html)

Used these templates:
