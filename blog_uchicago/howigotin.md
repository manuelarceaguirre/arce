I live 10 minutes from the border of the US and Mexico, and growing up I always heard that the rich kids only went to one high school on the other side of the border. As a kid, I did not know how much money my parents had. I did not ask for a lot of stuff but at the time, it was probably the most expensive middle school, and I got a scholarship for it. When it was time for entering high school I wanted to go to the high school across the border. My parents and I noticed they did not give scholarships. 

At that time I was on the national fencing team and had won tons of national competitions. Me and my parents had a meeting with a nun who was the principal and she said that they would give me a sports scholarship to go there. When we came back it was the first time I heard, "Son we can't afford it". It was as if my mind modified my paradigm that I would never make it to the US.

Fast forward, now I have a girlfriend who studied in a very expensive college in Los Angeles. The first time she took me to campus I cried because this was my dream. I did not want to be stuck in this place. I knew I wanted to start a life in the US, and I knew one of my options was to study and do a masters program. This step too would set me up for an O1 visa or H1B Visa and I could become an American.

I saw UChicago's program (Not knowing AT ALL the prestige and the acceptance rate, you know what's funny I looked up the acceptance rate after I paid for everything and submitted my application. Google said it was 6%-8%)  and thought that Applied Data Science was my best shot since I just graduated from a Bachelors in Actuarial Science from a Mexican University. I had similar classes and the program seemed very complete. I set up my first and only information session. I was lucky enough to have the call with one of the higher-ups, I believe. I once read that universities not only look at your grades and accomplishments – of course, they see that and that enters the equation – but another part of the decision to let you in or not to the party is values. 

So I asked the higher up 3 questions that revealed the hidden values of UChicago:

**Me:** What is different from UChicago than the other universities?
> "Academic Excellency bla bla the need for highly technical individuals in business decisions bla bla" 
nothing special ok NEXT
  
**Me:** What is different from the Applied Data Science program to the normal Data Science?
> "If you want to do a PhD go to Data Science, if not do the Applied" 
Okkk that's me NEXT

I wanted him to reveal the secrets that would let me in the door. I needed a theme in my application. Why am I better than another guy with perfect scores, awards, and success INSIDE the US? It's not a secret that Mexican curriculums are FKN EASY compared to these monsters.

**Me:** What do the faculty members believe in, things close to their heart?
> Collaboration is a big thing for us. 
FINALLY SOMETHING USEFUL!

So I decided to gather everything that I did in college and in my work life. Try to select the most Collaboration-oriented things and center my whole application on this single theme: Collaboration.

The important thing is I did not lie. I have this power that in classrooms I would always make friends the very first day and together we aced every exam and every homework by teaming up and beating the professor at his own game. In my past jobs, I have been the middle man lots of times and always made entire teams work together. 

## Letters of Recommendation
For the applied program you only need 2:
I asked one of the youngest teachers.

The other one, hear me out: in my current company my direct supervisor and the HEAD OF THE ENTIRE CONTINENT are named the same. So, thinking I was messaging my direct supervisor, I accidentally got a recommendation letter from the head of Americas. He was super cool about it. I forgot we hung out after one of the previous meetings and he remembered me because I was the only one in a dress shirt that meeting. If I were you, ask the top person in your company you have AT LEAST spoken to.

## Candidate Statement
I used this guy's template: 
[Swapnil-Gandhi/SoP-Template: LaTeX Template for Statement of Purpose (SoP)](https://github.com/Swapnil-Gandhi/SoP-Template)

## Resume/CV
[tuna🍣 on X: "Your Resumes Are Making Me Depressed and Ashamed " / X](https://x.com/tunahorse21/status/1833720902904643904)
Follow whatever he says.

## Programming Supplement
They ask for a 2-page PDF with code. I did that and at the end and at the top I put a link to a visual demo of the code:
[manuelarceaguirre/insurancemodel](https://github.com/manuelarceaguirre/insurancemodel)
[insurancemodelvisualizer.vercel.app](https://insurancemodelvisualizer.vercel.app/)

## Virtual Portfolio
Short, recorded videos.
Get a nice background, put on a dress shirt, be authentic, talk like you are giving a lecture but you are the really cool professor that sits at the desk and they make a clip out of you and they post it on X. That is the aura I went for.

## English Language Requirement
TOEFL resources I used. The speaking section was the only thing I did not have a perfect score when I practiced: [TOEFL TestReady](https://www.ets.org/toefl/test-takers/ibt/prepare/toefl-testready.html)

Used these templates:
