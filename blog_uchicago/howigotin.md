Growing up just 10 minutes from the US-Mexico border, I always heard this thing about "the rich kids' school" on the other side. As a child, I was blissfully unaware of my family's financial situation - I didn't ask for much, and money wasn't something I thought about.

When high school approached, I set my heart on attending that prestigious cross-border school. My parents and I discovered they didn't typically offer scholarships, but we managed to secure a meeting with the principal. At the time, I was competing on the national fencing team and had lots of national championships. During our meeting, an endearing nun who served as principal offered me something unexpected - a sports scholarship.

It was only after we left that meeting that I heard the crushing words from my parents for the first time: "Son, we can't afford it." That moment shifted something in my mind, creating a belief that the United States would always be out of reach for me.

I discovered UChicago's program - completely unaware of its prestige and acceptance rate at the time. Ironically, I only looked up the acceptance rate (a daunting 6%-8%) after I'd already paid for and submitted my application. Applied Data Science seemed like my best shot, given that I had just graduated with a Bachelor's in Actuarial Science from a Mexican university. The coursework aligned well with my background, and the program appeared comprehensive.

I scheduled my first and only information session, and by some stroke of luck, ended up having the call with one of the higher-ups in the program.

I once read that universities not only look at your grades and accomplishments but another part of the decision is only based on ✨vibes✨


When I asked about UChicago's unique qualities, I got the standard response:
> "Academic Excellency... need for highly technical individuals in business decisions..."

Nothing special ok NEXT
  
Then I asked about the difference between Applied Data Science and regular Data Science:
> "If you want to do a PhD go Data Science, if not do Applied" 

Okkk that's me NEXT

I wanted him to reveal the ✨vibes✨ that would let me in the door. I needed a theme in my application. Why am I better than another guy with perfect scores, awards, and success INSIDE the US? It's not a secret that Mexican curriculums are FKN EASY compared to these monsters.

So I asked the key question:
> "What do the faculty members believe in, what matters most to them?"
> "Collaboration is a big thing for us."

FINALLY SOMETHING USEFUL!

So I decided to gather everything that I did in college and work life. Try to select the most Collaboration-oriented things and center my whole application on this single theme: Collaboration.

I did not lie though. I have this power that in classrooms I would always make friends the very first day and together we aced every exam and every homework by teaming up and beating the professor at his own game. In my past jobs, I have been the middle man lots of times and always made entire teams work together. 

## Letters of Recommendation
For the applied program you only need 2:
I asked one of the youngest teachers.

The other one, hear me out: in my current company my direct supervisor and the HEAD OF THE ENTIRE CONTINENT are named the same. So, thinking I was messaging my direct supervisor, I accidentally got a recommendation letter from the head of Americas. He was super cool about it. I forgot we hung out after one of the previous meetings and he remembered me because I was the only one in a dress shirt that meeting. If I were you, ask the top person in your company you have AT LEAST spoken to.

## Candidate Statement
I used this guy's template: 
[Swapnil-Gandhi/SoP-Template: LaTeX Template for Statement of Purpose (SoP)](https://github.com/Swapnil-Gandhi/SoP-Template)

## Resume/CV
[tuna🍣 on X: "Your Resumes Are Making Me Depressed and Ashamed " / X](https://x.com/tunahorse21/status/1833720902904643904)
Follow whatever he says.

## Programming Supplement
They ask for a 2-page PDF with code. I did that and at the end and at the top I put a link to a visual demo of the code:
[manuelarceaguirre/insurancemodel](https://github.com/manuelarceaguirre/insurancemodel)
[insurancemodelvisualizer.vercel.app](https://insurancemodelvisualizer.vercel.app/)

## Virtual Portfolio
Short, recorded videos.
Get a nice background, put on a dress shirt, be authentic, talk like you are giving a lecture but you are the really cool professor that sits at the desk and they make a clip out of you and they post it on X. That is the aura I went for.

## English Language Requirement
TOEFL resources I used. The speaking section was the only thing I did not have a perfect score when I practiced: [TOEFL TestReady](https://www.ets.org/toefl/test-takers/ibt/prepare/toefl-testready.html)

Used these templates:
