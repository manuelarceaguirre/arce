Economic indicators to track

GDP
Basically to know if a country is in a recession? Export dips may follow
Indicator: NY.GDP.MKTP.CD
    Taiwan GDP contraction in 2023 -> chip export decline

PMI leading indicator
It asks manufacturing managers questions like:

    Are you getting more orders?

    Are suppliers delivering on time?

    Are you hiring more workers?

    Are raw material prices rising?

Each month, the answers are turned into a number between 0 and 100:

PMI Score	What It Means
Above 50	Factories are growing → economy expanding
Exactly 50	No change → neutral
Below 50	Factories are shrinking → slowdown or trouble

So PMI moves before trade data moves.
That’s why it’s called a leading indicator.

Exports % of GDP
how trade exposed a country is
high -> semiconductor drop can shake the economy

IMPKR -> US imports from South Korea
XTWUS -> Taiwan exports to the US
