# Why semiconductors matter globally
They are in everything now a days
No semiconductors = no computing = no digital economy

>       How big is the semiconductor industry compared to other “economies”?
They are strategic assets
all superforces treat the as critical infrastructure

semiconductors power ai defense autonomy

## Semiconductors are unique
Unlike oil or food no single country controls the full chip supply chain

US -> chip design NVIDIA AMD QUALCOMM
TAIWAN -> leading edge manufacturing TSMC
Netherlands -> photolitography ASML
Japan -> materials photoresist, sillicon wafers
Korea -> memory chips Samsung, SK Hynix
China -> massive low end production + growing mid end

            
>      When you say massive low en production do you mean competing with tsmc they are producing low end chips? and getting to medium?

Because each country has its own "role" this industry is fragile and interdependent


## Customs data is recorded and public

### Signals
    - Shipment surges -> rising demand (GPU exports)
    - Shipment drops -> slowdown, overstock, or policy restriction.

### Bottlenecks and geopolitical issues
    - China bans exports of gallium -> drop in China -> rest of the world rushes to find substitutes

>       What is gallium


#### Appendix
Gallium:
Critical mineral used in compound Semiconductors
China supplies 80% - 90% global gallium
In 2023 china restricted gallium exports

Low / Mid / Leading:
Low end chips: microcontrollers power ICs logic ICs
Mid: Autos industrial TSMC leads think - 28 - 65 nm
Leading edge No access to EUV ASML EMBARGO stuck at 7nm
Samsung is second?

How big is the semiconductor industry compared to other “economies”?
530 Billion -> 1 trillion by 2030

Digital Economy is 15 - 20% of global gdp
