# Meta's Vision (literally)

I have been seeing many guesses as to why Meta is investing so much into talent, infrastructure, and AI in general. Even though pay packages have allegedly been misrepresented or exaggerated, it is clear that Meta's final goal is to be at the top of the grand four labs. But what are Mark's intentions, and why now? Meta has never caught up to the SOTA models, so why not a year ago? I do not think Meta is aiming to be the leading API provider like Anthropic or seeking the popularity of OpenAI. Instead, I think they are trying to replicate Apple's iPhone moment with their own cash cow: Meta's glasses.

I do not live in the US (yet), but one of my friends has been trying to get his hands on the newest Meta Ray-Ban glasses. He told me the girl who worked at Sunglass Hut said that they are always out of stock. Apparently, demand for these glasses is significantly high.

[EssilorLuxottica recently reported](https://www.essilorluxottica.com/cap/content/259500/) Apparently revenue from sales of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses more than tripled year-over-year. Their new Oakley Meta glasses, which feature double the battery life, are now also available. Meta’s CFO Susan Li emphasized this trend in consecutive quarterly earnings calls:

* [Q1 2025 Earnings Transcript](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Transcripts/META-Q1-2025-Earnings-Call-Transcript-1.pdf):

> "Within our Reality Labs segment, Q1 revenue was \$412 million, down 6% year-over-year due to lower Meta Quest sales, which were partially offset by increased sales of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses."

* [Q2 2025 Earnings Remarks](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_downloads/2025/META-Q2-2025-Prepared-Remarks.pdf):

> "Within our Reality Labs segment, Q2 revenue was \$370 million, up 5% year-over-year due to increased sales of AI glasses, partially offset by lower Quest sales."

While anecdotal, my observations indicate significant public interest in these glasses. However, users frequently express frustration with the AI interactions. A common complaint illustrates this current gap in user experience:

> "You want to ask AI questions? It's frustratingly slow and ineffective unless you guide it step-by-step."

In my mind:

* **Meta has the product but not the model.**
* **All other companies have the model but not the product.**

We do not have all the information heads of million-dollar corporations do, but the players at this table have all placed their bets. Not all bets succeed (looking at you, Metaverse). However, Meta could genuinely succeed if they create a miracle run and bring back the magic we felt with Sonnet 3.5 but through glasses. This situation feels familiar to another bet that initially didn't seem logical the ballad of Sam Altman and Jony Ive, who want to create something Meta already has.
